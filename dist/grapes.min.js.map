Default: `div`\r\n * @property {Object} [attributes={}] Key-value object of the component's attributes, eg. `{ title: 'Hello' }` Default: `{}`\r\n * @property {String} [name=''] Name of the component. Will be used, for example, in Layers and badges\r\n * @property {Boolean} [removable=true] When `true` the component is removable from the canvas, default: `true`\r\n * @property {Boolean|String} [draggable=true] Indicates if it's possible to drag the component inside others.\r\n *  You can also specify a query string to indentify elements,\r\n *  eg. `'.some-class[title=Hello], [data-gjs-type=column]'` means you can drag the component only inside elements\r\n *  containing `some-class` class and `Hello` title, and `column` components. Default: `true`\r\n * @property {Boolean|String} [droppable=true] Indicates if it's possible to drop other components inside. You can use\r\n * a query string as with `draggable`. Default: `true`\r\n * @property {Boolean} [badgable=true] Set to false if you don't want to see the badge (with the name) over the component. Default: `true`\r\n * @property {Boolean|Array<String>} [stylable=true] True if it's possible to style the component.\r\n * You can also indicate an array of CSS properties which is possible to style, eg. `['color', 'width']`, all other properties\r\n * will be hidden from the style manager. Default: `true`\r\n * @property {Array<String>} [stylable-require=[]] Indicate an array of style properties to show up which has been marked as `toRequire`. Default: `[]`\r\n * @property {Array<String>} [unstylable=[]] Indicate an array of style properties which should be hidden from the style manager. Default: `[]`\r\n * @property {Array<String>} [style-signature=''] This option comes handy when you need to remove or export strictly component-specific rules. Be default, if this option is not empty, the editor will remove rules when there are no components, of that type, in the canvas. Eg. '['.navbar', '[navbar-']'. Default: `''`\r\n * @property {Boolean} [highlightable=true] It can be highlighted with 'dotted' borders if true. Default: `true`\r\n * @property {Boolean} [copyable=true] True if it's possible to clone the component. Default: `true`\r\n * @property {Boolean} [resizable=false] Indicates if it's possible to resize the component. It's also possible to pass an object as [options for the Resizer](https://github.com/artf/grapesjs/blob/master/src/utils/Resizer.js). Default: `false`\r\n * @property {Boolean} [editable=false] Allow to edit the content of the component (used on Text components). Default: `false`\r\n * @property {Boolean} [layerable=true] Set to `false` if you need to hide the component inside Layers. Default: `true`\r\n * @property {Boolean} [selectable=true] Allow component to be selected when clicked. Default: `true`\r\n * @property {Boolean} [hoverable=true] Shows a highlight outline when hovering on the element if `true`. Default: `true`\r\n * @property {Boolean} [void=false] This property is used by the HTML exporter as void elements don't have closing tags, eg. `<br/>`, `<hr/>`, etc. Default: `false`\r\n * @property {String} [content=''] Content of the component (not escaped) which will be appended before children rendering. Default: `''`\r\n * @property {String} [icon=''] Component's icon, this string will be inserted before the name (in Layers and badge), eg. it can be an HTML string '<i class=\"fa fa-square-o\"></i>'. Default: `''`\r\n * @property {String|Function} [script=''] Component's javascript. More about it [here](/modules/Components-js.html). Default: `''`\r\n * @property {String|Function} [script-export=''] You can specify javascript available only in export functions (eg. when you get the HTML).\r\n * If this property is defined it will overwrite the `script` one (in export functions). Default: `''`\r\n * @property {Array<Object|String>} [traits=''] Component's traits. More about it [here](/modules/Traits.html). Default: `['id', 'title']`\r\n * @property {Array<String>} [propagate=[]] Indicates an array of properties which will be inhereted by all NEW appended children.\r\n *  For example if you create a component likes this: `{ removable: false, draggable: false, propagate: ['removable', 'draggable'] }`\r\n *  and append some new component inside, the new added component will get the exact same properties indicated in the `propagate` array (and the `propagate` property itself). Default: `[]`\r\n * @property {Array<Object>} [toolbar=null] Set an array of items to show up inside the toolbar when the component is selected (move, clone, delete).\r\n * Eg. `toolbar: [ { attributes: {class: 'fas fa-arrows-alt'}, command: 'tlb-move' }, ... ]`.\r\n * By default, when `toolbar` property is falsy the editor will add automatically commands like `move`, `delete`, etc. based on its properties.\r\n * @property {Collection<Component>} [components=null] Children components.
