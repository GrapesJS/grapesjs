Default: `['id', 'title']`\n * @property {Array<String>} [propagate=[]] Indicates an array of properties which will be inhereted by all NEW appended children.\n *  For example if you create a component likes this: `{ removable: false, draggable: false, propagate: ['removable', 'draggable'] }`\n *  and append some new component inside, the new added component will get the exact same properties indicated in the `propagate` array (and the `propagate` property itself).
