# Internationalization

The **I18n** module allows the internationalization and update of strings in the editor UI

::: warning
This guide is referring to GrapesJS v0.15.9 or higher

The module was added recently so we're open to receive support in [translating strings in other languages](#adding-new-language). Your help will be much appreciated!
:::

## Configuration

By default, the editor includes only the English language, if you need other languages you have to import them manually.
**Note**: The language code is defined in the [ISO 639-1] standard.

```js
import grapesjs from 'grapesjs';
import it from 'grapesjs/locale/it';
import tr from 'grapesjs/locale/tr';

const editor = grapesjs.init({
  ...
  i18n: {
    // locale: 'en', // default locale
    // detectLocale: true, // by default, the editor will detect the language
    // localeFallback: 'en', // default fallback
    messages: { it, tr },
  }
});
```

Now the editor will be translated in Italian for those browsers which default language is Italian (by default `detectLocale` option is enabled)

## Update strings

If you need to change some default language strings you can easily update them by using [I18n API](/api/i18n.html).
To find the correct path of the string you can check the [`en` locale file] and follow its inner path inside the locale object.

Let's say we want to update the default message of the empty state in Style Manager when no elements are selected.

<img :src="$withBase('/sm-empty-state.jpg')">

From the `en` locale file you can see it by following the path below

```js
{
    ...
    styleManager: {
        empty: 'Select an element before using Style Manager',
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

So now to update it you'll do this

```js
editor.I18n.addMessages({
  en: {
    // indicate the locale to update
    styleManager: {
      empty: 'New empty state message',
    },
  },
});
```

Even if the UI shows correctly the updated message, we highly suggest to do all the API calls wrapped in a [plugin](Plugins.html)

```js
const myPlugin = editor => {
    editor.I18n.addMessages({ ... });
    // ...
}

grapesjs.init({
  // ...
  plugins: [myPlugin],
});
```

### Generated strings

Not all the strings are indicated in the `en` local file as some of them can be generated from `id`s, `name`s, etc.
If you look back at the `styleManager` path from the `en` file you'll notice the empty `properties` key

```js
...
styleManager: {
    ...
    properties: {
        // float: 'Float',
    },
    ...
},
...
```

This object is used to translate property names inside StyleManager, so if you need, for instance, to change the auto-generated names for the `margin` properties

<img :src="$withBase('/margin-strings.jpg')">

you'd this

```js
editor.I18n.addMessages({
  en: {
    styleManager: {
      properties: {
        // The key is the property name (or id)
        'margin-top': 'Top',
        'margin-right': 'Right',
        'margin-left': 'Left',
        'margin-bottom': 'Bottom',
      },
    },
  },
});
```

<!--
### Updates post rendering

If you try to update strings, by using API, once the UI is rendered you'll see no changes.
...
We need to find the way to update the UI

## Adding new language

If you want to support GrapesJS by adding a new language to our repository all you need to do is to follow steps below:

1. First of all, be sure to check the language file in [`src/i18n/locale`](https://github.com/GrapesJS/grapesjs/blob/master/src/i18n/locale) doesn't exist already
1. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/GrapesJS/grapesjs/issues/new?title=XX%20Language%20support) to avoid overlap with other contributors. To be sure, check also no one else has opened already an issue for the same language
1. Start a new branch from `dev`
1. Copy (in the same folder) and rename the [`en` locale file] to the name of your language of choice (be sure to be compliant to [ISO 639-1])
1. Now you can start translating strings
1. By following comments you'll probably notice that some keys are not indicated (eg. `styleManager.properties`), for the reference you can check other locale files
1. Once you've done, you can create a new Pull Request on GitHub from your branch to `dev` by making also a reference to your issue in order to close it automatically once it's merged (your PR message should contain `Closes #1234` where 1234 is the issue ID)

## Plugin development

::: warning
This section is dedicated **only** to plugin developers and can also be skipped in case you use [grapesjs-cli](https://github.com/GrapesJS/cli) to init your plugin project
:::

If you're developing a plugin for GrapesJS and you need to support some string localization or simply change the default one, we recommend the following structure.

```
plugin-dir
- package.json
- README.md
- ...
- src
    - index.js
    - locale // create the locale folder in your src
        - en.js // All default strings should be placed here
```

For your plugin specific strings, place them under the plugin name key

```js
// src/locale/en.js
export default {
  'grapesjs-plugin-name': {
    yourKey: 'Your value',
  },
};
```

In your `index.js` use the `en.js` file and add `i18n` option to allow import of other local files

```js
// src/index.js
import en from 'locale/en';

export default (editor, opts = {}) => {
  const options = {
    i18n: {},
    // ...
    ...opts,
  };

  // ...

  editor.I18n.addMessages({
    en,
    ...options.i18n,
  });
};
```

The next step would be to compile your locale files into `<rootDir>/locale` directory to make them easily accessible by your users. This folder could be ignored in your git repository be should be deployd to the npm registry

::: warning
Remember that you can skip all these long steps and init your project with [grapesjs-cli](https://github.com/GrapesJS/cli). This will create all the necessary folders/files/commands for you (during `init` command this step is flagged `true` by default and we recommend to keep it even in case the i18n is not required in your project)
:::

At the end, your plugin users will be able to import other locale files (if they exist) in this way

```js
import grapesjs from 'grapesjs';

// Import from your plugin
import yourPlugin from 'grapesjs-your-plugin';
import ch from 'grapesjs-your-plugin/locale/ch';
import fr from 'grapesjs-your-plugin/locale/fr';

const editor = grapesjs.init({
  ...
  plugins: [ yourPlugin ],
  pluginsOpts: {
      [yourPlugin]: {
          i18n: { ch, fr }
      }
  }
});
```
